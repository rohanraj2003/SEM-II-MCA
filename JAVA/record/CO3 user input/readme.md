# CO3 Java Programs

This directory contains Java programs that demonstrate various concepts such as method overloading, inheritance, array operations, and class structures. The following programs are included:

---

### Q1  
**Area of different shapes using overloaded functions**  

[View program](./Q1.java)

---

### Q2  
**Create a class ‘Employee’ with data members Empid, Name, Salary, Address and constructors to initialize the data members. Create another class ‘Teacher’ that inherits the properties of class Employee and contains its own data members department, subjects taught, and constructors to initialize these data members. Also, include a display function to display all the data members. Use an array of objects to display the details of N teachers.**

### Q3  
**Create a class ‘Person’ with data members Name, Gender, Address, Age, and a constructor to initialize the data members. Another class ‘Employee’ inherits the properties of class `Person` and adds its own data members like Empid, Company_name, Qualification, Salary, and its own constructor. Create another class ‘Teacher’ that inherits the properties of class `Employee` and contains its own data members like Subject, Department, Teacherid. Include constructors and methods to display the data members. Use an array of objects to display the details of N teachers.**

### Q6  
**Create an interface having the prototype of functions `area()` and `perimeter()`. Create two classes, Circle and Rectangle, which implement the above interface. Create a menu-driven program to find the area and perimeter of the object.**  

[View program](./Q6.java)
